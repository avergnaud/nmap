# nmap

Nmap's scanning process typically consists of two distinct phases:
1. Host Discovery: Determines if the target is alive (reachable on the network).
2. Port Scanning: Identifies open ports on the target.

During host discovery: if the target does not respond to these probes, Nmap assumes the host is down and skips the port scanning phase.
